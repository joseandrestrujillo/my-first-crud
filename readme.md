# My first CRUD in JavaScript Vanilla
Hi! This is my first CRUD project and there is based on JavaScript Vanilla. I have tried to include the most important concepts of web development in JS in this project in order to learn as much as possible from it. The CRUD includes:
- Add a new item option.
- Delete an existing item.
- Edit an existing item.
- Possibly to mark an item as complete.
- Filter option to search items by a word or if there are completed or not.
- All items will be save on the localStorage.
